rest/http for high level (socket based)

async. 1 RS(transient server)—data validation
						enqueues
						replies MAX_CAPACITY

			queue of fixed MAX_Length

 ….dispatcher dequeues and calls handler synch.
	1 handler per service
		service handler calls sensor routine	
	dispatcher is owner of return value via socket info (Rx from daemon)


		

POTENTIAL - call async  using 1 process per service/sensor
	pros - parallelism
	cons - sync
		- low expoected request volume
		- difficult to implement
